## Introduction
This is an R Markdown document recording the step by step analysis of the Chariton County (Missouri) financial reports from 2009 through 2015. Chariton County currently has a population of 7,589 residents, and an assessed valuation of $216,030,641. The data in the dataset **chariton.csv** comes directly from the annual reports published in the Chariton County Journal newspaper the last week of February of ever year. 

**Summary:** Chariton County currently has over 5.2 million dollars in savings. The average annual surplus for the past seven years is just over $340,000 (excluding outlier year 2013). The annual surplus is the excess of all county revenues minus all county expenditures. In 2015, the county began the year with $4,542,000 in cash, and ended the year 2015 with $5,222,000 cash on hand. In 2015 the cash on hand earned $74,000 in interest for the county. The 2015 surplus, that is excess revenues over expenditures, was $679,000.

Here is the data file:
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape2)
library(scales)
chariton <- read.csv('./charitonfinancials.csv')
```

```{r}
chariton
```

The variables in the dataset represent the following data:  
**year** = reporting year, January 1 through December 31  
**begincash** = reported amount of cash on hand at the beginning of the year  
**revenues** = total amount of money received from the county, includes property tax, sales tax,   law enforcement tax, road and bridge tax, federal and state funds, etc.  
**propertytax** = amount of revenues received from the county property tax  
**salestax** = amount of revenues received from the county sales tax  
**interest** = amount of interest received from the cash in the county's accounts  
**expenditures** = total amount of money spent by the county  
**surplus** = difference between revenues and expenditures each year  
**endcash** = reported amount of cash on hand at the end of the year  

All amounts are in U.S. dollars ($).  

From the dataset, we can see that in 2015, the county began the year with $4,542,000 in cash, and ended the year with $5,222,000 cash on hand. This amount of cash on hand earned $74,000 in interest for the county. The 2015 surplus, that is excess revenues over expenditures, was $679,000. The average annual surplus over the past seven years is $507,000:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
round(mean(chariton[, 'surplus']))
```
Removing the surplus for year 2013 (an unusual year with one-time property tax receipt from the pipeline company), the average surplus is over $340,000:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
round(mean(chariton[c(1,2,3,4,6,7), "surplus"]))
```
Using the latter number, the average, annual revenue surplus exceeds $340,000, which has resulted in a healthy "rainy day" fund of over $5.2 million at the end of 2015.

The mean of the different variables in the dataset is:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
round(colMeans(chariton[, c(2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9)]))
```

## Plots of the data

Plotting the annual revenues, expenditures, surplus, and ending cash balance for the past seven years, with a bar chart:
```{r, echo = FALSE}
chariton.melt <- melt(chariton[, c(1,3, 7, 8, 9)], id=c('year'),vars=c('revenues', 'expenditures', 'propertytax', 'salestax', 'surplus', 'endcash'))
ggplot(data=chariton.melt, aes(year, value)) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill=variable), stat = 'identity', position = 'dodge')  +
  labs(list(title = "Chariton County Financial Summary (2009-2015)", x = "Year", y = "US $")) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels=comma) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = round(seq(min(chariton.melt$year), max(chariton.melt$year), by = 1))) +
  scale_fill_discrete(name=NULL, breaks=c('revenues', 'expenditures', 'endcash', 'surplus'), labels=c('Revenues', 'Expenditures', 'Cash on Hand', 'Surplus'))
```

A line chart is more readable:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data=chariton.melt, aes(x=year, y=value, group=variable, color=variable)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point(size=3, fill='white') +
  labs(list(title = "Chariton County Financial Summary (2009-2015)", x = "Year", y = "US $")) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = round(seq(min(chariton.melt$year), max(chariton.melt$year), by = 1))) +
  scale_colour_discrete(name=NULL, breaks=c('revenues', 'expenditures', 'endcash', 'surplus'), labels=c('Revenues', 'Expenditures', 'Cash on Hand', 'Surplus'))
```
